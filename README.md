# IDM-Migration-ScriptedCREST

IDM upgrade process requires in-place upgrade of IDM servers and database. This in-place upgrade can result in some downtime. Many deployments requires zero downtime migration which requires parallel IDM deployment  <br />
This module provides custom CREST connector for migration of IDM managed objects.  <br /> 

REST connector for IDM migration: <br />
1. Managed users migration <br />
2. Managed roles with assignments migration <br /> 
3. 

These features are not currently supported in this implementation: <br />
1. LiveSync of managed objects from old to new IDM <br />
2. Relationships migration <br />
3.


Pre-requisites :
================
* Versions used for this project: IDM 4.0 -> IDM 5.0 migration. 
1. IDM 4.0 has been installed and configured. 
2. IDM 5.0 has been installed. 

IDM 4.0 Configuration:
=================================================
1. Password property in managed objects need to be updated so that it is viewable via REST.
2. 


IDM 5.0 Configuration:
=====================
1. Import openidm-sym-default key from IDM 4.0 to IDM 5.0 deployment. This will make sure that passwords encrypted by IDM 4.0 can be decrypted by IDM 5.0.
